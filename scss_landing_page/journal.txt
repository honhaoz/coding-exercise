I googled “SCSS tutorial” and then clicked the first one on the search result:
https://www.toptal.com/sass/theming-scss-tutorial (Fernando Rivas’s blog)
I quickly read through it to get an overall picture of how SCSS works and what it is.

I want to try some simpler examples with explanations from a different person.
I then clicked some other search results further down the list and chose this one from Andrew Richards:
 https://medium.com/swlh/learn-the-scss-sass-basics-in-5-minutes-73002653b443
However, the SCSS code I wrote does not work as the CSS file does not recognise the syntax.

I then google searched about how SCSS works with HTML.
I got the following article from Sass documentation: https://sass-lang.com/guide/

However, the sass command does not work.
I then follow this guide to install Sass: https://sass-lang.com/install/

I read and practised the SCSS by going backwards from the articles I found. 
wrote the simplest SCSS codes from Andrew Richards’s article to ensure my SCSS code can compile to CSS code that works with HTML files. 
started a pet project which is a simple landing page for a consultancy company. The landing page should have a button that can toggled between 2 different themes. I used ChatGPT to quickly generate landing page templates. 
created the SCSS file and moved the CSS codes over. 
refactored the codes using knowledge from Fernando Rivas’s blog. 
Created a second theme and created a button and javascript file for toggling the theme.
I further refactored the code by using Sass map.
The project is available on GitHub:
